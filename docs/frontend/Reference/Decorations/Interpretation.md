```mathematica
Interpretation[display_, expression_]
```
allows to alter the displayed expression

__An expression will be revealed after 1 evaluation__

:::tip
For the best performance optimization __apply__ [CreateFrontEndObject](../Frontend%20Objects/CreateFrontEndObject.md) if you use interactive objects as `display` value.

For example

```mathematica
Interpretation[TextView["Hello"], 1]
```
has __more overhead__ than

```mathematica
Interpretation[TextView["Hello"] // CreateFrontEndObject, 1]
```

It will help interpreter to bypass extra layers of complexity.

Note that you don't need to do this for [Graphics](../Graphics/Graphics.md), [Graphics3D](../Graphics3D/Graphics3D.md), [Image](../Graphics/Image.md) and input elements, since it is done __automatically__
:::
## Example
Have a look at the following example

```mathematica
Interpretation[Red, 1]
```
