```mathematica
MMAView[head_[args__]]
```

```mathematica
MMAView[_Animate]
```

```mathematica
MMAView[_Manipulate]
```

```mathematica
MMAView[_Graphics3D]
```

attempts to use Mathematica's frontend (technically backend) to render given expression to a raster [Image](frontend/Reference/Image/Image.md) and return it back.

WLJS Notebook does not support all possible styling and diagram types compared to Wolfram Mathematica. Here we give a user a workaround, which might be suitable for many cases.

For example

```mathematica @
Plot3D[(*SpB[*)Power[x(*|*),(*|*)2](*]SpB*) (*SpB[*)Power[y(*|*),(*|*)2](*]SpB*), {x,0,1}, {y,0,1}] // MMAView 
```

## Graphics3D
We have a special wrapper for [Graphics3D](frontend/Reference/Graphics3D/Graphics3D.md) -like plots to make them interactive in the session

```mathematica
With[{p = Plot3D[f[x] y, {x,0,10}, {y,0,10}]},
  MMAView[p]
]
```

:::note
Note, that it is important to pass it using `With`, since `MMAView` has `HoldFirst` attribute. Otherwise the direct pass will give your a static plot

## Manipulate
There is a similar wrapper for [[Manipulate]]

```mathematica
Manipulate[Plot[Sin[x y], {x,0,1}], {y,0,5}] // MMAView
```

:::warning
It literally streams uncompressed raster images in real-time. Please do not overuse it, and try to use WLJS dynamics in general if possible.
:::

If it detect `Graphics3D` inside `Manipulate` it also provides mouse controls over it

```mathematica
Manipulate[Plot3D[Sin[n x] Cos[n y], {x,-1,1}, {y,-1,1}], {n, 1, 5, 1}] // MMAView
```

## Animate
The same as before but for [Animate](frontend/Reference/GUI/Animate.md)

```mathematica
Animate[Plot[Sin[x y], {x,0,1}], {y,0,5}] // MMAView
```
