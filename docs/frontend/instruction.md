# Quick start
Frontend __does not require anything installed__ apart from `wolframscript` (see Freeware [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) or Wolfram Kernel). 

:::info
Make sure that Wolfram Engine is activated and no other instance of `wolfram` is running on your Mac/PC
:::

There is two ways you can choose from
## Using "native" application
Frontend is also shipped as an Electron cross-platform application, that makes you feel like if you were using a real desktop app. However it takes care about updates and other management, __this is the easiest way__

__[Download Link](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend/releases)__

## Via console & web-browser
Then download `.zip` from [master branch](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend) or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend
cd wolfram-js-frontend
```

then run the script

```bash
wolframscript -f Scripts/run.wls
```

It will take some time to download all core plugins, after that you can start using it by opening your browser 

```bash

[Fri 9 Jun 2023 13:43:38] ::Tiny Web Server:: starting
[Fri 9 Jun 2023 13:43:38] ::Tiny Web Server:: listening
Open http://127.0.0.1:8090 in your browser
```

:::note
UI works well with most modern browsers, except Safari, where one might expect to see some glitches in an equation editor.
