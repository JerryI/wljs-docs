Then you select which plot to export and as a result you get two section of HTML/JS code: *head* and *figure itself*

The head contains all libraries and core scripts and can be reused for all figures on the same page.

:::tip
Remove libraries, which are not used in your plots from the head section to reduce the loading time of your website. WLJS cannot guess it automatically.

The code section for the figure can be embedded to any place in your HTML document. Feel free to customize CSS.
