__Open .nb files__

:::warning
This feature is still in $\alpha$ stage
:::

We provide an automatic conversion of Wolfram Mathematica's `.nb` notebook files to WLJS Notebook `.wln`. It transfers input cells with almost no changes, while output cells are transcoded to a suitable for WLJS format

There is a problem with styling of the text, which is tricky to convert and render. As one can see on the screenshot it is still far from being perfect

If we summarize, what might not work

- complex text formatting
- __output cells__
- multilayer nested structure
- iconized expressions
- some styling options for `Graphics` and `Graphics3D`
- stored image / video / audio data inside cells
